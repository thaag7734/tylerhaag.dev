      I&apos;m a software engineer who is passionate about learning and creating cool things.
      Since I was very young, I&apos;ve had an unshakeable interest in technology
      - some of my fondest childhood memories are working on telecom equipment with my
      dad, writing code for bad games, and taking electronics apart (rest in peace to
      the many VCRs, hard drives, and the like which didn&apos;t survive this learning
      process). This exposure to technology and passion for learning led me to quickly
      fall in love with software engineering, where I can use code to solve real problems
      and there&apos;s always something left to learn.

    <span>
      I prefer to work with PHP (Laravel) and TypeScript, but I have some experience with
      other languages as well, including vanilla JS, Python, and Java. I have built and
      deployed applications with various backend stacks using React on the frontend, but
      I&apos;m currently looking into creating some new projects using other frontend
      frameworks, such as Vue and Svelte.
